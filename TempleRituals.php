            PRACTICES</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Why do you do temple rituals and how do you receive</h4>
        <p>Young and old have questions as to why certain rituals are performed 
            and certain traditions followed at the temple. Our parents, whom we 
            never questioned, have passed much of what we do at the temples today, 
            down to us. The present generation’s thirst for knowledge has not left 
            our practices unquestioned. This article is an amateur attempt to put 
            things in perspective, and to give some meaning and significance to 
            these practices.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>To examine some of them:</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>Removing footwear</h4>
        <p>
          It is the Hindu custom to remove footwear before entering THE LORDS 
          HOUSE. Or any house for that matter. It is believed that footwear 
          carries germs dust and dirt from the streets. It is also customary 
          for people to wash their hands and legs before they enter any temple. 
          This is an example of how Hindus maintained sanitation and cleanliness 
          of their surroundings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Why do the priest chant so many prayers?</h4>
        <p>
            Prayer is the ultimate way for one to communicate with the almighty. 
            The priests are a medium through whom one can communicate with the 
            Almighty. Prayer with devotion brings about inner peace and invokes 
            the Brahman (God) within you. When slokas are chanted with correct 
            pronunciation and intonation, a divine atmosphere is created with 
            holy vibrations all around.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Aarathi</h4>
        <p>
            It is a ritual performed in the worship of Hindu Gods, whereby a 
            lighted lamp or lighted camphor is moved circularly (clockwise) around 
            the idol. The sanctum sanctorum is usually dark, the idol is carved 
            usually out of black stone, and Aarathi removes darkness and reveals 
            the form of the Lord to you when the priest moves the lamp all around 
            the idol. Before electricity was invented, the only way devotees could 
            see the actual idol was when the priest performed aarathi. This also 
            reminds us that God can lead us from darkness to light and from 
            ignorance to knowledge “ Tamaso – ma Jyotirgamaya”. When the priests 
            bring the flame to the devotees, it is customary to run both the palms 
            of ones hand over the flame and then pat the palms over ones eyes as a 
            mark of absorbing the Almighty’s light into ones body. It should also 
            be remembered that fire is a purifying agent and what is pure is what 
            is offered to the Lord.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Theertha or how does one receive the holy water?</h4>
        <p>
            It is the Hindu belief that all prayers chanted will invoke the Lord, 
            in fire, water and air. Spiced water is offered to the Lord during 
            the chanting of hymns. When the priests chant the mantras they imbue 
            the water with good spirits, example the holy rivers, protecting 
            elements (5 Life controlling elements) praana, apaana, vyaana, udaana, 
            samaana and God himself. Water is thus turned to “THEERTHA” 
            (holy water) during pooja. At the end of a pooja after distribution 
            of the aarathi the priest hands out only half a spoon of this holy 
            water to the devotee, in order that this holy water may be absorbed by 
            the body and never desecrated, excreted or spilt on the floor. It is a 
            practice among orthodox south Indian seniors, to visit their 
            neighboring temples after morning rituals and receive this holy water 
            before eating any solid food each day. Theertha should be received by 
            placing a cup shaped form of the right hand over the left and sipped 
            in, so that the Theertha does not run off to the floor and what is 
            left over may be sprinkled on top of ones head. It is also a 
            practice in South India for people to place the end of their sari or 
            dhothi under the cup shaped right hand as a means to absorb the 
            excess water spill, if any. Theertha should be received with 
            reverence and devotion. Theertha usually contains water, tulsi 
            (mint like herb), flavoring agents, lilac, cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, 
            cooking camphor.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Prasaadam: What is prasaadam and how do you receive it?</h4>
        <p>
            Food offerings to the Almighty is called prasaad, it may be tulsi 
            leaves (plant), flowers, nuts, raisins, coconut, fruits etc. These 
            become sanctified as the priests offer them to the Lord by chanting 
            the proper mantras (prayers) invoking the vital airs 
            (the pancha pranas). Anything offered to the Lord must be given with 
            devotion and a pure heart and he is said to accept it. As Krishna 
            says in the Gita Patram Pushpam Phalam Toyam Yo me Bhaktya Prayacchati 
            Tadaham Bhakty –upahratama –snaami prayaattmanah I will accept a 
            leaf, flower, a fruit or water offered to me with devotion and a pure 
            heart. The prasaad is only an expression which states that whatever 
            produce of nature one obtains, or food which one has prepared, is 
            actually HIS and one should consume it only after it is offered to 
            the Lord. After the pooja is over, the priests distribute a small 
            serving of prasaad to each devotee, which is to be consumed. When 
            a meal is offered to the Lord, it is usually partaken by the offered, 
            his family and friends. It should not be treated carelessly or 
            discarded. It is not a practice to eat regular meals in front of 
            the sanctum sanctorum. In Indian temples there are special places 
            designated for this purpose. It is also a time to remember your 
            creator and thank him for all the blessing of food that you receive.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Shataari or blessing from a crown</h4>
        <p>
            Shataari is the Sri Vaishnava practice of placing a silver crown 
            on the devotee’s head by the priest. Shataari comes from the word 
            removal or emancipation from wickedness and evil (Shata means 
            wickedness and ari means evil), which you seek at the feet of 
            the Lord. Shataari is synonymous with “Paduka” (footwear) of 
            Sri Rama. When Rama was exiled to the forest, Bharatha his brother 
            was distraught and wanted Rama to come back to reign the kingdom of 
            Ayodhya, Rama removed his “Paduka” and gave it to his brother. 
            Bharata placed it on the throne and mythology says that the 
            footwear protected the world, in Rama’s absence. If one closely 
            observes the crown, one will see 2 feet impressions of Lord Vishnu 
            on top. Men should receive with both hands covering the nose and 
            a bowed head by women and with folded hands and a head bent down 
            Shataari. Receiving the Shataari signifies the surrendering to 
            the feet of the Lord and asking him mercy to relieve you from 
            all wickedness. The purpose of various adornments (marks) on 
            the forehead: Applying whatever it may be Vibhuthi, Kumkum, 
            Chandan or Naamam on the forehead and other parts of one’s body 
            is a form of decoration of the Lord within (Paramatman, Atman) 
            and it is also considered a blessed gift (prasaadam) from the 
            Almighty.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Vibhuthi scared ash</h4>
        <p>
            The authoritative Bhargava dictionary gives the following meanings 
            for the word Vibhuthi: excellence, dignity, majesty, dominion, 
            and some more, and also a celestial missile given to Rama by 
            Viswamitra. Vibhuthi in Sanskrit means prosperity, wealth and 
            glory. Vibhuthi is ash collected from burnt organic matter. 
            Perhaps all the above “qualities” and “power” can be attributed 
            from its various meanings to Vibhuthi, the organic holy dust 
            worn on the foreheads of saivite worshipers ( Shiva, Parvathi, 
            Ganesa, Subramanya). Shiva, the ascetic is visualized as covered 
            with ash, which is fragrant as mentioned in the commonly chanted 
            “ MRUTUNJAYA JAPA MANTRA”, (for him) “sugandham”(sweet smelling). 
            When one applies Vibhuthi, it is a constant reminder that the 
            material being is perishable and that we should look for the 
            imperishable (nitya) the Brahman within us. After all, isn’t 
            the ultimate destination of the human body ash! Vibhuthi is 
            also said to have medicinal value. And is used in the mantric 
            type of healing. As the story goes, not only did Saint 
            Thirughana Sambandhar had to cure the stomach disease of the 
            Jain King Koonpandian, of Madhurai (7th Century), but also 
            had to prove to the king that it had medical value. The saint 
            while composing the poem Mandiram –aavathu Neeru took a hand 
            full of Vibhuthi and applied it on the king’s body. This gave 
            the king immediate relief and he converted himself to a Hindu. 
            History also records that the people of Tamilnadu converted 
            from Jainism to Hinduism after this. Vibhuthi should be taken 
            with the right hand and applied on the fore-head as three 
            horizontal lines. The first line stands for removal of Ahankar 
            (pride) the next stands for removal of ignorance and the third 
            stands for removal of bad karma (actions). Ardent Shaivite men 
            apply the Vibhuthi on nine parts of the upper body, the forehead, 
            on both the upper arms, elbows, wrists, neck and chest. Vibhuthi 
            applied with faith, is said to increase intellectual power and 
            prosperity. Sivapuranam and Tirumandiram extol the use of 
            Vibhuthi in great detail. Tirumalar, another poet says 
            “Gangalan Poosum Kavacha Tiruneetrai”, glorifying the use of Vibhuthi.

        <br>
        <h4>Naama</h4>
        <p>
            The U or Y shaped marking, adorning the fore-head of Vaishnavites 
            the followers of vishnu adorn their foreheads with a Naamam. 
            It consists of either a U or Y shaped outer white marking and 
            either a red or yellow straight line in the middle. The white 
            paste is from china clay paste and the red vermillion paste 
            made from turmeric, which is yellow but can be dyed red. The 
            white lines represent Vishnu and the red Lakshmi. White stands 
            for purity, while the red indicates brilliance, symbolizing wealth 
            and riches from Lakshmi. Some wear a yellow line amidst the 2 white 
            lines, which signifies the person comes from a very spiritual and 
            pious background. The Naamam is usually worn by the men, while the 
            Sri charanam (single red line) is worn by women in the Sri Vaishnava 
            sect. Naamam give a cooling effect when exposed to scorching sun 
            (china clay and sandal paste are antidotes). Ardent Vaishnavite 
            men apply the namam on the top of head, forehead, both upper 
            arms, fore-arms, neck and chest.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Kumkuma: Red vermillion powder</h4>
        <p>
            Combining turmeric with limestone, which changes its color from 
            yellow, makes Kumkum to red. It is applied to the center of the 
            forehead as a circle or tilak. Many non-Indians question the 
            purpose of the Kumkum and many of us do not have an answer, 
            here is how it can be answered, the Kumkum or any mark on the 
            forehead signifies that the person belongs to the Hindu religion. 
            Of course people of other faiths also adorn it as a mark of beauty. 
            With the Muslim occupation, usage of Kumkum, gained momentum and 
            then in the last century has moreso evolved into a cosmetic 
            representation, assuming different shapes and colors. Kumkum is 
            associated with the worship of female deities, Lakshmi, 
            Parvathi and Saraswathi. It is considered auspicious, an 
            indication of good fortune and prosperity and is considered 
            particularly fortunate for a long happy married life. The red 
            color of the Kumkum is associated with fire. Fire is considered 
            energy, so another interpretation is, Kumkum represents 
            energy(Shakthi).It is customary among South Indian families 
            to offer Kumkum to women visitors as a way of honoring them. 
            In North Indian Practice, Kumkum applied on the parting of a 
            woman’s hair symbolizes marriage. Adoring the forehead with 
            Kumkum between the eyes is also a way to honor Lord Shiva’s 
            third eye, which was supposed to be powerful and distructive.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Gopi use of sandalwood paste and saffron</h4>
        <p>
            Lord Krishna is usually seen with a yellow U on his forehead 
            which is sandalwood paste mixed with saffron. This is called 
            Kasturi tilakam. Sandalwood paste is also used in poojas and 
            at the end of the services some of it is distributed to the 
            devotees. In temples like Guruvayoor the idol is fully smeared 
            with sandal paste during abhishekam and at the end of the pooja 
            the same paste is distributed as prasadam to all. The use of 
            sandal wood paste is more common among Madhvacharya followers. 
            This fragrant paste is used by men on their own bodies while 
            performing Sandhya-Vandanam, the personal ritual worship that 
            one is inducted into after the sacred thread ceremony among 
            Brahmins (Upanayanam). The paste is applied moist to vital 
            parts of the body and the mark of discus (Chakra) and Conch 
            (Shanku) is made invoking the divine energy. Chandan is 
            customarily received with the middle finger and worn on 
            the forehead and the neck.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Namaskaaram salutation by prostrating in front of god and elders</h4>
        <p>
            It is the Hindu tradition to bow down to the Supreme and to the 
            elders by kneeling and bowing ones head to the floor. There are 
            2 postures, which are practiced by Hindus. The Astanga posture 
            is when all 8 limbs of the body touch the floor (face down 
            sleeping posture). This is also called Sashtaanga Namaskaaram. 
            This is recommended to be done by the men only. The Panchaanga 
            Pranaamam or 5 parts of the body touching the floor(head, 
            shoulders and hands, knees, feet) is done by men and women. 
            This is a kneeling posture with the head bowed down to the floor. 
            In temples prostrations of these types are done only to the Gods. 
            Outside temples they are done to elders. Prostrations should not 
            be done to those who are sleeping or still in wet clothes. One 
            should not also bow down to those who are younger in age. In the 
            Vaishnava practice the men in the family prostrate and then announce 
            their name, ancestry and school of thought (abhivadanam) after they 
            have had their upanayanam (thread ceremony). Usually one announces 
            his gotra, the three or five sages one is descendent from, the 
            sutra one follows, the vedas one follows and then ones name to 
            receive blessing from elders. These announcements are not made 
            before God, Sages, Sanyasis, or women other than ones mother. 
            Abhivadanam is an interesting practice handed down from generation 
            to generation without any documentation. It was unique way of 
            maintaining a record of the family background, school of thought, 
            Vedic study and background of the individual.
        </p>

        <h4>Lighting of an oil lamp</h4>
        <p>
            Lighting an oil lamp at the altar at dawn and at dusk at the 
            temple and in homes is a beautiful custom among the Hindus. 
            Light is a manifestation of Goddess Lakshmi, symbolizing knowledge, 
            brilliance, health and wealth. The oil lamp is adorned with 
            sandal paste, Vermillion and fragrant flowers. Hindus believe 
            that by lighting lamps, they are inviting their favorite Gods 
            and Goddesses into their hearts and dwellings.

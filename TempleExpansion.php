        <h4>About our Temple</h4>
        <p>
          HTKY was founded in 1985 and was expanded and dedicated in 1999. It is 
          the passion and commitment of some early comers to Louisville and their 
          devotion and the untiring efforts over 30+ years, that has helped us 
          realize this dream Temple !
          <br>
          Our Temple is a like a blanket that allows for many heart-warming 
          experiences that are both uplifting and spiritual. It brings our 
          community TOGETHER and importantly helps us practice and live our 
          TRADITION and CULTURE. It enables us to relive those precious moments 
          and leave a legacy for FUTURE GENERATIONS to experience and cherish.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Why Grow Now ?</h4>
        <p>
            The increasing devotee base, rising Hindu School enrollment, and a 
            need for more space for some of the larger events (listed below) are 
            some of the forces driving the Temple expansion. Some major events are 
            listed below:

            Average event attendance of 500+ with Diwali topping 1000+ devotees.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are blessed by the Gorgeous and Beautiful Deities and the peaceful 
            sacred space our Priests help create.
        </p>
        <p>
            The volunteer-run Hindu School, which had its humble beginning in the 
            year 2000, today boasts an enrollment of approximately 150 students and 
            growing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several language classes including the Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and other 
            educational opportunities (SAT prep course), Dance performances, 
            Classical concerts have leveraged the Temple Hall consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Annually several large cultural and social events are held across 
            Louisville and OUR hope is to see these hosted at the Temple.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Why new Temple Hall?</h4>
        <p>
            Existing Temple Hall has a city approved occupancy limit of 150 
            devotees, which makes the hall overcrowded on most major events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given increased participation of children in the Hindu School, there 
            is a need to accommodate existing and potentially growing demand for 
            educational services.
        </p>
        <p>
            To eliminate other major limitations, including acute shortage of 
            storage space, inadequate coat/shoe racks, classroom/multi-use space, 
            congested alleys, crumbling priest quarter stairs, office room and 
            many more..
        </p>
        <p>
            Challenge of finding space during weekends for devotees wanting to 
            perform personal events and celebrations and other religious services 
            at Temple
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>What is the Return on this project?</h4>
        <p>
            As a newcomer to Louisville, you find out there is a Temple here, a 
            surge of moral support and spirituality arises, can you measure that ?
        </p>
        <p>
            As a parent, when you take your children to India, folks back home are 
            in awe to see and hear our kids recite shlokas and the puranas, can 
            you measure that?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ederly parents visiting from India are delighted and uplifted when 
          coming to OUR temple, and knowing that our culture and customs are still 
          thriving, can you put a value to those feelings and experiences ?
        </p>

        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          Check with the priests the auspicious time and date to perform the 
          ceremony in addition to duration of ceremony. Add to the duration, 
          the necessary transportation time (to and fro). This is how many hours 
          you need to keep the priest away from the Temple duties.If this time 
          exceeds EIGHT hours, you will be assessed an additional charge of 
          $100.00. Ask the priests an alternate date and time if the first set 
          is not feasible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          You can download the Reservation Form or obtain at the Reception Desk 
          in the Temple. After obtaining completed form, Temple Administrator 
          will calculate the applicable charges. You will get a call back with 
          the estimate to get your approval. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          If you are paying by credit card, your card will be charged with the 
          authorized amount and your reservation process is complete. If you are 
          paying by check, you have THREE WORKING DAYS to send your check in 
          favor of “Hindu Temple of Kentucky, Inc.” to the exact amount and send 
          it to Temple Administrator, Puja Services, Hindu Temple of Kentucky, 
          4213 Accomack Drive, Louisville, Kentucky 40241. If check is not 
          received within three working days, the slot will be vacated and 
          released for the next paid devotee in line. RESERVATIONS ARE NOT 
          CONFIRMED WITHOUT PAYMENT OF APPLICABLE FEES.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Priests are notified of their appointments on a weekly basis. Devotees 
          shall call the priests directly and request for a list of supplies 
          needed for the ceremony and keep them ready for the occasion. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Devotees shall contact the priests and advice them of the transportation 
          arrangements as well as contact numbers for emergency situations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Please make arrangements to pick the priest ON TIME and return them to 
          the TEMPLE at the SCHEDULED TIME. Not following this rule UPSETS the 
          operation of the TEMPLE and subsequent activities. LATE CHARGES ARE 
          APPLICABLE IF RETURNED LATE.
